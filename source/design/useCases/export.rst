* Primary actor: an implementer
* Goal: a exported set of mappings

Main Success Scenario
=====================

To achieve the goal the actor will:

#. Obtain a copy of the repository from the public host;
#. run a ‘Query’ on the repository to return the shards relevant to their implementation:
#. parse the returned shards for use in an external application.
