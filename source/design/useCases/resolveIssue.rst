* Primary actor: an editor
* Secondary actors: owners
* Goal: An agreed resolution to an identified issue
* Dependencies:

  * Raise Issue

Main Success Scenario
=====================

To achieve the goal the primary actor will:

#. initiate an ‘Edit Mappings’ process;
#. Ensure that the branch resolves the raised issues.
#. Contact the secondary actors detailing the changes requested:

   * All owners of translation elements which have been edited must be contacted and must agree to the change for it to proceed.

#. Iterate changes until agreement is reached.
#. Initialise a ‘Pull Request’.
