* Primary actor: an editor
* Goal: a proposal for a translation mapping to be moved from ‘draft’ to ‘approved’

Main Success Scenario
=====================

To achieve the goal the actor will:

 #. Initiate an ‘Edit’ including one or more changes of state from ‘draft’ to ‘proposed’
 #. For each of these changes of state, or a coherent collection of such changes, a ticket is raised in the ticketing system.
 #. The ticket will reference the pull request and the explicit change (or changes) proposed for approval.
 #. A relevant approver will be assigned the ticket by the editor.
 #. Initiate a ‘Pull Request’ for the changes.
