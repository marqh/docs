Information Stored 
*******************

The MetaRelate project contains an informaiton repository, called MetOcean.  This may be joined by other repositories in the future.

These repositories store semi-structured information as `RDF`_.

.. _RDF: http://www.w3.org/RDF/


The structure of the RDF enables queries to be run on the contained data, usiong `SPARQL1.1`_.

.. _SPARQL1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/


The information structure is extensible, the structure is not fixed, but this description representsa minimum set which is required for the current set of queries used in the mapping manager.
